# LangGraph ReAct Agent for AI Avatar Video Generation

This AI Agent enables you to create educational video content from a simple text input. You can enter a topic, and the agent will use all or some of the available tools accordingly:

1. Search for reliable information – It gathers relevant sources online to ensure the content is fact-based.
2. Generate a concise script – It creates a structured, engaging script tailored to the given topic.
3. Create a talking avatar video – The script is transformed into a video where a digital avatar presents the information.
4. Download the video – You can save the generated video for personal use.

You can quickly produce AI generated educational videos without any technical expertise.

## Agent Tools
* **TavilySearch:** Using [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) for semantic and contextual web search. **NOTE:** The Agent determines whether to invoke a tool based on user input. If you want to force a specific tool to be used, modify the ```system_prompt```. For example: **Important: Always use TavilySearch to ensure up-to-date information.**
* **ScriptGenerator:** OpenAI GPT-4o powered.
* **DIDAvatarGenerator:** Calling [D-ID](https://www.d-id.com/) for avatar animation. **Important** Read the D-ID image requirements section!
* **AvatarDownloader:** Local file download tool.

### D-ID image requirements & more
* Public URL ending with the image name. **_You can use GitHub but make sure to take the raw image link!!!_** Example of raw link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenyss/AIAvatarAgent/main/Eli_cat.jpeg<br>

❗ **Warning:** I deleted Eli_cat.jpeg since I didn't want my daughter ending as your avatar.😊 Please take care to substitute the image in the ```generate_avatar``` function. I forgot to expose it as an arg in the main function. You can modify the payload to customize the avatar's speech according to your needs.

* Image size up to 10 MB!
* **Only human faces**, won't work with animal photos!
* **Image resolution matters!** D-ID will fail with high resolution images. I tested it with images roughly around 1280x1280 px and it works fine.
* Check [D-ID API](https://docs.d-id.com/reference/createtalk) for the configuration of the avatar, e.g. TEXTSCRIPT > Provider where you can select the text to speech provider and different languages, personalities, speaking styles, etc

## Intallation

[INTRO]
Welcome to our guide on growing tomatoes. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced gardener, these tips will help you cultivate healthy, delicious tomatoes.

[SECTION 1: CHOOSING VARIETIES]
Start by selecting the right tomato variety for your climate and space. Determinate types are compact, ideal for containers, while indeterminate types grow larger and need staking.

[SECTION 2: PLANTING]
Choose a sunny spot with at least 6-8 hours of sunlight. Prepare the soil by mixing in compost or well-rotted manure. Plant seedlings deep, burying two-thirds of the stem to encourage strong root growth.

[SECTION 3: WATERING]
Water consistently, aiming for 1-2 inches per week. Water at the base to avoid wetting the leaves, which can lead to disease. Mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.

[SECTION 4: SUPPORTING PLANTS]
Use stakes, cages, or trellises to support your plants. This keeps fruit off the ground, reducing the risk of rot and pests.

[SECTION 5: FERTILIZING]
Feed your tomatoes with a balanced fertilizer every 4-6 weeks. Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers, which promote foliage over fruit.

[SECTION 6: PRUNING]
Prune suckers, the small shoots between the main stem and branches, to improve air circulation and direct energy to fruit production.

[SECTION 7: PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT]
Monitor for pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic pesticides or introduce beneficial insects. Rotate crops annually to prevent soil-borne diseases.

[SECTION 8: HARVESTING]
Harvest tomatoes when they are firm and fully colored. Gently twist and pull from the vine. Enjoy them fresh or preserve them for later use.

[OUTRO]
With these steps, you'll enjoy a bountiful tomato harvest. Happy gardening!<br>
