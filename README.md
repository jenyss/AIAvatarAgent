# LangGraph AI Agent for Educational Content with AI Avatar

This AI Agent enables you to create educational video content from a simple text input. You can enter a topic, and the agent will use all or some of the available tools accordingly:

1. Search for reliable information ‚Äì It gathers relevant sources online to ensure the content is fact-based.
2. Generate a concise script ‚Äì It creates a structured, engaging script tailored to the given topic.
3. Create a talking avatar video ‚Äì The script is transformed into a video where a digital avatar presents the information.
4. Download the video ‚Äì You can save the generated video for personal use.

You can quickly produce AI generated educational videos without any technical expertise.

## Agent Tools
* **TavilySearch:** Using [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) for semantic and contextual web search. **NOTE:** The Agent determines whether to invoke a tool based on user input. If you want to force a specific tool to be used, modify the ```system_prompt```. For example: **Important: Always use TavilySearch to ensure up-to-date information.**
* **ScriptGenerator:** OpenAI GPT-4o powered.
* **DIDAvatarGenerator:** Calling [D-ID](https://www.d-id.com/) for avatar animation. **Important** Read the D-ID image requirements section!
* **AvatarDownloader:** Local file download tool.

### D-ID image requirements & more
* Public URL ending with the image name. **_You can use GitHub but make sure to take the raw image link!!!_** Example of raw link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenyss/AIAvatarAgent/main/Eli_cat.jpeg<br>

‚ùó **Warning:** I deleted Eli_cat.jpeg since I didn't want my daughter ending as your avatar.üòä Please take care to substitute the image in the ```generate_avatar``` function. I forgot to expose it as an arg in the main function. You can modify the payload to customize the avatar's speech according to your needs.

* Image size up to 10 MB!
* **Only human faces**, won't work with animal photos!
* **Image resolution matters!** D-ID will fail with high resolution images (at least on the free plan). I tested it with images roughly around 1280x1280 px and it works fine.
* Check [D-ID API](https://docs.d-id.com/reference/createtalk) for the configuration of the avatar which you should pass in the payload of the ```generate_avatar``` function. See TEXTSCRIPT > Provider where you can select the text to speech provider and different languages, personalities, speaking styles, etc

[INTRO]<br>
Welcome to our guide on growing tomatoes. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced gardener, these tips will help you cultivate healthy, delicious tomatoes.<br>
<br>
[SECTION 1: CHOOSING VARIETIES]<br>
Start by selecting the right tomato variety for your climate and space. Determinate types are compact, ideal for containers, while indeterminate types grow larger and need staking.
<br>
[SECTION 2: PLANTING]<br>
Choose a sunny spot with at least 6-8 hours of sunlight. Prepare the soil by mixing in compost or well-rotted manure. Plant seedlings deep, burying two-thirds of the stem to encourage strong root growth.
<br>
[SECTION 3: WATERING]<br>
Water consistently, aiming for 1-2 inches per week. Water at the base to avoid wetting the leaves, which can lead to disease. Mulch around plants to retain moisture and suppress weeds.
<br>
[SECTION 4: SUPPORTING PLANTS]<br>
Use stakes, cages, or trellises to support your plants. This keeps fruit off the ground, reducing the risk of rot and pests.
<br>
[SECTION 5: FERTILIZING]<br>
Feed your tomatoes with a balanced fertilizer every 4-6 weeks. Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers, which promote foliage over fruit.
<br>
[SECTION 6: PRUNING]<br>
Prune suckers, the small shoots between the main stem and branches, to improve air circulation and direct energy to fruit production.
<br>
[SECTION 7: PEST AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT]<br>
Monitor for pests like aphids and caterpillars. Use organic pesticides or introduce beneficial insects. Rotate crops annually to prevent soil-borne diseases.
<br>
[SECTION 8: HARVESTING]<br>
Harvest tomatoes when they are firm and fully colored. Gently twist and pull from the vine. Enjoy them fresh or preserve them for later use.
<br>
[OUTRO]<br>
With these steps, you'll enjoy a bountiful tomato harvest. Happy gardening!<br>
